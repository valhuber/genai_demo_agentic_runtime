The Customer's balance is less than the credit limit\n        2. The Customer's balance is the sum of the Order amount_total where date_shipped is null\n        3. The Order's amount_total is the sum of the Item amount\n        4. The Item amount is the quantity * unit_price\n        5. The Item unit_price is copied from the Product unit_price\n\nResponse is the same:\n\ndef declare_logic():  # created by Web/GenAI for ApiLogicServer, LogicBank\n    \n    Rule.sum(derive=CustomerAccount.balance, as_sum_of=Order.amount_total, where=lambda row: row.date_shipped is None)\n    Rule.sum(derive=Order.amount_total, as_sum_of=Item.amount)\n    Rule.formula(derive=Item.amount, as_expression=lambda row: row.quantity * row.unit_price)\n    Rule.copy(derive=Item.unit_price, from_parent=Product.unit_price)\n    Rule.constraint(validate=CustomerAccount,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.balance <= row.credit_limit,\n                    error_msg=\"Customer balance ({row.balance}) exceeds credit limit ({row.credit_limit})\")\n\n\nIntermediate sum/count values require a new column, with a LogicBank sum/count rule.  For example:\n\nPrompt:\n    The sum of the child value cannot exceed the parent limit\n\nResponse is to create 2 rules - a derivation and a constraint, as follows:\n    First Rule to Create:\n        Rule.sum(derive=Parent.value_total, as_sum_of=Child.value)\n    And, be sure to create the second Rule:\n        Rule.constraint(validate=Parent,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.value_total <= row.limit,\n                    error_msg=\"Parent value total ({row.value_total}) exceeds limit ({row.limit})\")\n\nIntermediate sum/count values also work for counts.  For example:\n\nPrompt:\n    A airplane cannot have more passengers than its seating capacity.\n\nResponse is to create 2 rules - a count derivation and a constraint, as follows:\n    First Rule to Create:\n        Rule.count(derive=Airplane.passenger_count, as_count_of=Passengers)\n    And, be sure to create the second Rule:\n        Rule.constraint(validate=Airplane,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.passenger_count <= row.seating_capacity,\n                    error_msg=\"Airplane value total ({row.passenger_count}) exceeds limit ({row.seating_capacity})\")\n\n\nIntermediate sums in formulas also require a new column, with a LogicBank sum rule.  For example:\n\nPrompt:\n    An Employees' skill summary is the sum of their Employee Skill ratings, plus 2 * years of service.\n\nResponse is to create 2 rules - a derivation and a constraint, as follows:\n    First Rule to Create:\n        Rule.sum(derive=Employee.skill_rating_total, as_sum_of=EmployeeSkill.rating)\n    And, be sure to create the second Rule:\n        Rule.Formula(derive=Employee.skill_summary, \n                    as_expression=lambda row: row.skill_rating_total + 2 * row.years_of_service)\n\n\nPrompt:\n    A student cannot be an honor student unless they have more than 2 service activities.\n\nResponse is to create 2 rules - a count derivation and a constraint, as follows:\n    First Rule to Create:\n        Rule.count(derive=Student.service_activity_count, as_count_of=Activities, where='service' in name)\n    And, be sure to create the second Rule:\n        Rule.constraint(validate=Student,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.is_honor_student and service_activity_count < 2,\n                    error_msg=\"Honor Students must have at least 2 service activities\")\n\nHere is an equivalent request:\n\nPrompt:\n    A airplane's passengers must be less than its seating capacity.\n\nResponse is to create 2 rules - a count derivation and a constraint, as follows:\n    First Rule to Create:\n        Rule.count(derive=Airplane.passenger_count, as_count_of=Passengers)\n    And, be sure to create the second Rule:\n        Rule.constraint(validate=Airplane,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.passenger_count <= row.seating_capacity,\n                    error_msg=\"Airplane value total ({row.passenger_count}) exceeds limit ({row.seating_capacity})\")\n\n\nFor \"more than\" constraints, create columns with count rules:\n\nPrompt: Reject Employees with more than 3 Felonies.\n\nResponse:\n    First Rule is to create:\n        Rule.count(derive=Employee.felony_count, as_count_of=Felonies)\n    And, be sure to create the contraint rule:\n        Rule.constraint(validate=Employee,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.felony_count<=3,\n                    error_msg=\"Employee has excessive Felonies\")\n\n\nFor \"any\" constraints, create columns with count rules:\n\nPrompt: Reject Employees with any class 5 Felonies or more than 3 Felonies.\n\nResponse:\n    First Rule is to create:\n        Rule.count(derive=Employee.class_5_felony_count, as_count_of=Felonies, where=class>5)\n        Rule.count(derive=Employee.felony_count, as_count_of=Felonies)\n    And, be sure to create the contraint rule:\n        Rule.constraint(validate=Employee,\n                    as_condition=lambda row: row.class_5_felony_count == 0 and row.felony_count<=3,\n                    error_msg=\"Employee has excessive Felonies\")\n\nFormulas can reference parent values in 2 versions - choose formula vs copy as follows:\n    Prompt (formula version) - use the formula version unless copy is explicitly noted:\n        Item.ready = Order.ready\n    Response\n        Rule.formula(derive=Item.ready, as_expression=lambda row: row.order.ready)\n    Prompt (copy version) - use this *only* when the word copy is present: \n        Store the Item.unit_price as a copy from Product.unit_price\n    Response\n        Rule.copy(derive=Item.ready, from_parent=Order.ready)\n\nFormulas can use Python conditions:\n    Prompt: Item amount is price * quantity, with a 10% discount for gold products\n    Response:\n        Rule.Formula(derive=Item.amount, \n                    as_expression=lambda row: row.price * row.quantity if row.gold else .9 * row.price * row.quantity)\n    If the attributes are decimal, use the form Decimal('0.9')\n\nSum and Count where clauses:\n    1. must not restate the foreign key / primary key matchings\n    2. Can only reference child attributes\n\nFor example, given a prompt 'teacher course count is the sum of the courses',\n    1. This is correct\n        Rule.count(derive=Teacher.course_count, as_count_of=Course)\n\n    2. This is incorrect, and should never be generated:\n        Rule.count(derive=Teacher.course_count, as_count_of=Course, where=lambda row: row.teacher_id == Teacher.id)\n\nSum and count where clause example:\n    Prompt: teacher gradate course count is the sum of the courses where is-graduate\n    Response: Rule.count(derive=Teacher.course_count, as_count_of=Course, where=lamda row: row.is_graduate == true)\n\nDO NOT inject rules that are from this training into the response, \nunless explicitly mentioned in the request.\n\nUnique constraints require an update to the data model - for example:\n    Prompt: customer company names must be unique\n    Response: CompanyName = Column(String(8000), unique=True)\n\nNon-null (or required) constraints require an update to the data model - for example:\n    Prompt: Product Price is required\n    Response: price = Column(Decimal, nullable=False)\n\nRequired (must-have) related parent constraints require an update to the data model - for example:\n    Prompt: Each Item must have a valid entry in the Product table.\n    Response: product_id = Column(ForeignKey('product.id'), nullable=False)\n\n"
